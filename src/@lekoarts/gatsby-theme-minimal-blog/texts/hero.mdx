  Hi.
</Text>

I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Anthropology](https://www.anthropology.uci.edu/) at the University of California, Irvine. My research examines the digital data and instructure that communities need to effectively address entangled economic, environmental and public health challenges. Read more [here](https://www.timschuetz.org/about).

I am co-developing a series of collaborative research, infrastructure and pedagogy [projects](www.timschuetz.org/projects).

You can find me on the [Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography](https://worldpece.org/content/tim-sch%C3%BCtz/essay) (PECE), [Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tmschtz)
