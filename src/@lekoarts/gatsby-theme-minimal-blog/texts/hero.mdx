  Hi.
</Text>

I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Anthropology](https://www.anthropology.uci.edu/) at the University of California, Irvine. My research examines the digital data and instructure that communities need to effectively address entangled economic, environmental and public health challenges. Learn more [about](https://www.timschuetz.org/about) my research and recent [publications](https://www.timschuetz.org/publications).

I am co-developing a series of collaborative research, infrastructure and pedagogy [projects](www.timschuetz.org/projects). You may be interested in material for the course [Beyond Environmental Injustice](https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/environmental-injustice-summer-2020/essay). 

You can find me on [Academia.edu]([https://uci.academia.edu/TimSch%C3%BCtz](https://uci.academia.edu/TimSch%C3%BCtz)), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tmschtz) and the [Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography]() (PECE). I also edit a monthly research update for PECE, you can as sign up [here](https://github.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=28f50ca38ef652df957d5cbd6&id=0ed4893b1f).
