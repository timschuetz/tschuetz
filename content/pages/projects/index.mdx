I currently participate in and co-develop a series of collaborative research, teaching and infrastructure projects:

## Quotidian Anthropocenes

[Quotidian Anthropocenes,](http://disaster-sts-network.org/content/quotidian-anthropocene/essay) sponsored by Haus der Kulturen der Welt and Max Planck Institue for the History of Science Berlin

## Transnational STS COVID-19 Project

The TRANSnational-STS Covid-19 Project brings together researchers in the interdisciplinary field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) to follow and analyze COVID-19 as it plays out in different settings. The project has a [digital work space](https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/transnational-sts-covid-19-project/essay), share a [Zotero bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/groups/130725/disastersts/collections/HAL645VD) and connect through an email list and Zoom video conferencing.

The aim of this project is build a social science research process and infrastructure to support on-going, open-ended examination of the cultural transformations resulting from -- and called for by -- the COVID-19 pandemic. The work will be transnational and collaborative, building comparative and global perspectives on ways COVID-19 is characterized as a problem, governed and challenges established norms and ethical-political visions

To join the project or learn more, contact Duygu Kasdogan ([duygukasdogan@gmail.com](mailto:duygukasdogan@gmail.com)) or Kim Fortun ([kfortun@uci.edu](mailto:kfortun@uci.edu)).
