## Environmental Injustice

Environmental Injustice (see [course website](https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/environmental-injustice-summer-2020/essay)) is a lower-division undergraduate course taught by Prof. Kim Fortun at the University of California Irvine.

In the course, students analyze environmental disasters, pollution, and the causes and impacts of climate change -- and how these impact human health and worsen social inequalities. They also study how people have become environmental activists to find and advocate for solutions.

The course examines many different factors that contribute to environmental problems (social, political, economic, biochemical, technological). It is designed to give students in different majors (in the social and natural sciences, public health, engineering, urban planning and the humanities) the opportunity to work together in interdisciplinary research teams, leveraging their different skills.

Through collaborative work with other students, engaging different points of view, they develop your own environmental and professional ethics. Students also develop research skills that can be used in other courses, independent research and many job settings.
