I'm very excited for **Asylum For Sale: Profit and Protest in the Migration Industry** to come out in August 2020. 

[Monic Meisel](https://de.linkedin.com/in/monicmeisel) (co-founder of Freifunk Berlin) and I wrote a chapter about Internet access for refugees and asylum seekers in Germany. We're focusing particularly on how commercial Internet and mobile service providers currently profit from lack of access -- and how community networks like Freifunk can offer potential solutions.

Pre-ordering directly supports PM Press, the independent publisher based in Oakland, California that -- despite the COVID-19 lockdown --  committed to a full color, high quality but still affordable publication.
