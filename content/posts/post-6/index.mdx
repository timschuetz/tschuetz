[Mapping Fast Disaster](https://mapping-fast-disaster.netlify.app/) is a new project I started with undergraduate students in the course [Environmental Injustice](https://mapping-fast-disaster.netlify.app/). The website provides a growing overview of datasets, maps and visualizations that document facilities in Southern California storing chemicals with potential for rapid explosion ("fast disaster").

We already published a map of Risk Management Plan (RMP) Facilities and currently work on a map of facilities that store ammonium nitrate (fertilizer).
