I'll be giving two virtual presentations at the upcoming [4S/EASST Conference](https://www.easst4s2020prague.org/) (August 18–21), originally scheduled to be held in Prague. The first focuses on my current research on the Taiwanese plastics company Formosa. The second is a co-presentation with James Adams (UC Irvine) about the projects Visualizing Toxic Subjects/Places.

You can find abstracts for both presentations below.

#### **Civic Data for the Anthropocene: Visualizing Taiwan’s Formosa Plastics**

Panel: "Holding It Together? Data And Disasters" organized by Louise Elstow and Ben Epstein.

*In October 2019, Taiwanese petrochemical company Formosa Plastics agreed to pay a record settlement of $50 million for their release of plastic pellets into Lavaca Bay and Cox Creek in Texas. The settlement was achieved by a group of activists that made extensive use of “citizen science” (TRLA 2019). In Louisiana – in the petrochemical corridor known as “death alley” – environmental justice groups working in the spirit of “bucket brigades” are challenging the opening of a new Formosa Plastics Plant (Mosbrucker 2019). And in Kaohsiung, following an explosion at a Formosa-owned naphtha cracking facility, Taiwanese citizens have pushed back against the expansion of the company and argued for advanced data collection (Tu 2019).*

*In all three cases here, civic data work has been a key tactic in responding to petrochemical disasters, fast and slow (Nixon 2011; Knowles 2019). Activists in these three cases also recognize the need to build infrastructures for connecting their sites and cases. In this presentation, I will draw on interviews with activists US and Taiwan to begin imagining what civic data practices and infrastructure are needed to support response to Formosa going forward. Members of the audience will be asked to help sketch this out, helping move the “informating of environmentalism” (Fortun 2004) forward, tuned to the Anthropocene. The Formosa project extends from and contributes to two collaborative projects, one focused on knowledge infrastructures for Quotidian Anthropocenes and another focused on Visualizing Toxic Places.*

#### Installation Ethnography: Curation, Aesthetics, Experiments

Co-presentation with James Adams (UC Irvine)

Panel: "Aesthetic Interventions: Exploring emerging worlds through art" organized by Regula Valérie Burri and Joe Dumit.

*What does the immersive space of an art installation offer STS scholars that cannot be achieved with a standard, peer reviewed article? In this presentation, we will describe experiments with installation in the “Visualizing Toxics” projects hosted by the University of California Irvine’s Center for Ethnography. These projects (“Visualizing Toxic Subjects,” 2019 and “Visualizing Toxic Places,” 2020) were designed to explore "toxicity" in many guises (chemical, discursive, gendered, mediated, and others), and ways toxicity can be conveyed and analyzed through diverse modes of visualization (expanding how visualization is conceived, developed and used in STS research). In both projects, geographically distributed participants produced diverse visualizations (as digital photo essays) that were collaboratively analysed to advance their critical effects. In the 2019 project, select visualizations were presented in a gallery show designed to foreground different modes of visualization. For the 2020 show, we will use our visualizations -- and other sensory devices - to draw out the dynamics of toxicity. Working with professional installation designer (and anthropologist) Scott Lukas, we will learn about and experiment with diverse tactics and techniques for producing critically e/affective installations. We expect our April 2020 installation in Irvine to work not only with visualizations but also with sound, light and perhaps ambient color and smell. Other, differently designed installations may be set up at other sites, allowing for generative comparisons.*
